## Below will be the steps I took when following the hands on lab:
___________________________________________________________________________

1. Generated a Docker linode session via Linode.
2. Pulled the centos OS from the simulated Docker terminal.
  - Used: "docker pull centos"
3. Created a centos container and named it.
  - Used: "docker run -d -t --name dockercontainerOne centos"
4. Opened my newly created container. This initiated another terminal which could be used in the new container.
  - Used: "docker exec -it dockercontainerOne bash"

[I repeated the steps above for two more distributions such as Alpine and Ubuntu Linux.]

- I also utilized 'hub.docker.com'
