# Docker-Lab
Short lab to get hands on with Docker software.
3/7/25

This lab was conducted alongside a video on youtube providing hands on experience with Docker, a platform dedicated to the use of containers. The lab was brief and gave my first hands-on experience with container software. The experience taught me how to create, view, and manage containers. All of this was completed through Linode.
